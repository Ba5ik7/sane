# Sails-Ember Starter Kit

##Overview
Sails-Ember Starter Kit will help you started with rapid Web App prototyping and development. It includes, what are in our opinion the best tools for backend and frontend development. They will save you an immense amount of time, make development smoother and deliver the best results that work optimally across multiple devices.

So what exactly does this kit include?

* A sensible folder structure so you can develop Server and client seperately, but they integrate smoothly
* A [SailsJS Vagrant Box](https://github.com/Globegitter/vagrant-sailsjs) coming with [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever), MongoDB, MySQL and Redis all set-up to work properly.
* Using [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) in the `client` folder, already set-up, using the latest 0.0.41 dev version (See https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli#working-with-master). In addition we are already including sass and foundation to get started more quickly with frontend styling.

To find out more about Sails and Ember and how they work together, you can take a look at my talk
[http://vimeo.com/103711300](http://vimeo.com/103711300) and slides [http://talks.artificial.io/sailing-with-ember/
](http://talks.artificial.io/sailing-with-ember/)

##Quickstart
* Clone this project
* To get the server up: Run `vagrant up`, then `vagrant ssh` and cd into `~/server`, run `npm install` and code away
* Run `sails lift` to get the server started on `localhost:1337`
* In the `client` folder run `npm install` and `bower install`
* Run `ember serve` to get the dev server with auto-reload running on `localhost:4200`
* So in dev-mode simply think of your ember app as you would of any other client, for example an Android app.


##Deployment
Deployment works quite well now but still has a few manual steps

* Run `ember build --environment=production` in the `client` folder. Then ` cp -rf dist/* ../server/assets/` and  `cp -f dist/index.html ../server/views/index.ejs` to copy all the static content, as well as the Ember App itself to your sails-server
  * Sails is configured to serve the index.ejs/the Ember App on all routes, so the Ember can take full control
* If you are using Sails just as an internal API, make sure that CORS is deactivated in your production environment.
* To start your app just run `forever start app.js --prod`. As long as you only update your ember-app you don't have to do a anything anymore. If you are making changes to the Server itself, any of the controllers, etc. you do have to restart your server.

If you are interested in some other deployment strategies you can look at this tutorial:

based on this talk:

This strategy can be taken over, pretty much the same way to your Sails Project.

##Thanks
Thanks to [mphasize](https://github.com/mphasize) for creating [sails-ember-blueprints](https://github.com/mphasize/sails-ember-blueprints) which overwrites the default SailsJS JSON response to the one that Ember Data's `RESTAdapter` and `RESTSerializer` expects.

##Contribution
Everyone is more than welcome to contribute in any way: Report a bug, request a feature or submit a pull request. Just keep things sensible, so we can easily reproduce bugs, have a clear explanation of your feature request, etc.
